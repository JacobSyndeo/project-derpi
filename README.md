# project-derpi
An iOS app for derpibooru.org.

## What's this?
This app is a client for Derpibooru, a pony imageboard. The app loads images from the site and displays them with a nice, native UI. We all love ponies, but it's hard to view or search for pictures of them when we're on our phones. There are currently no published Derpibooru clients for iOSâ€”this app seeks to remedy that!

### Currently it can:
* View the /images results. Basically the homepage of derpibooru
* Search for images. Use search terms the same way you would on the website
* Filter search results by different order. You can also filter them using the specific search terms
* View details of the image posts, including descriptions, tags and comments

### Planned features
* Login system
* Users' watch list
* Change active filters: This has to be tied with the login system since App Store requires some form of censorship with user-generated content. So something has to be done with filtering images that are not completely safe/vanilla.
* Parsing the texts in comments and in description
  
## But don't these apps get rejected from the stores?
I suppose so. Booru sites aren't exactly the most friendly towards copyrights and content filtering. I know the android version for derpibooru was rejected. This app was submitted to TestFlight a year ago, and it got approved. That's a good sign, but it doesn't really mean much. Worst-case scenario, that I'll leave the code here for anyone to build onto their phones, but it requires the users to know how to do that. Another solution is to ditch login and set a strict filter to the images, since it might make Apple more comfortable allowing the app onto the store.

I can only know when I actually submit it for approval, but at the current state the app is not ready for submission yet.

## But it's buggy
The project is work-in-progress, and as such, bugs are to be expected.

## Information about the app
It requires iOS 9 or above, available for both iPhone and iPad.
